function [obsTestStat,bootTestStat, p] = StudentBootstrapTest(obs1,obs2, replicates)
% A studentized two sample bootstrap hypothesis test that compares the 
% difference between two sample means via a T-statistic. Although it uses
% the two sample t-test to compare means without the assumption of equal
% variance, it is a nonparametric test because the p-value is based on
% the distribution of test-statistics generated from sampling with
% replacement. Hence, it is a hypothesis test of no difference between 
% sample means that performs better with skewed distributions than a
% classic two sample t-test.

% Input:
%   obs1 = The first sample (a column or row vector)
%   obs2 = The second sample (a column or row vector)
%   fun = The statistic of comparision as a function ( e.g. @(x)mean(x),@(x)median(x), @(x)std(x))
%   replicates = number of bootrap experiments
%
% Output:
%   obsTestStat = The test statistic used to compare bootstrap statistics
%   bootTestStat = The vector of bootstrap test statistics 
%   p = a ratio of the sum of boot-test-statistics that are greater or 
%       equal to the observed-test-statistic and the number of bootstraps/replicates

%Create a container for the boot-statistics

%Get the observation statistic

%Combine the observations (The null hypothesis is samples are the same)

%Perform bootstrap for every replicate
for ii = 1:1:replicates
    %Bootstrap from the combined twice
